# Some TODO's

So far it's a really basic webapp. There's a lot more to do to make it useful for adding content ect.

But also there's more on the tech side that should be done to make sure that pushing code for a deployment isn't going to break the live site.

- [ ] Add a front end and compile static assets.
- [ ] Add some code style checking e.g. pre-commit.
- [ ] Add some CI actions for running tests and code-style checks for new work.
- [ ] And probably more ...

I intend to tick off the above asap.
