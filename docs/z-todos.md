# Some TODO's

So far it's a really basic webapp. There's a lot more to do to make it useful for adding content ect.

But also there's more on the tech side that should be done to make sure that pushing code for a deployment isn't going to break the live site.

- [ ] Add a front end and compile static assets.
- [ ] And probably more ...

I intend to tick off the above asap.
