# Create a git repo to store the source code

> I'm using `Github` for this project.

Create a new repo on your preferred provider. Github can add some files for you when starting a new project, I decided to add a `README` file and a `gitignore` file for `Python`.

Clone the newly created repo to your local development machine. It will have a remote called `origin`. Later on I'll create a remote called `production` which I'll use to deploy the site to PythonAnywhere.
